Title: App type for Scenario 1


## Context 

We need to decide whether to develop the app as a Native, Web, or Hybrid application for the creation of a mobil app 
for a retail company in scenario 1. The app's requirements include supporting offline mode, push notifications,
payment gateway integration, analytics tracking and image display optimization.

## Decision 

Have decided to use react native

## Rationale

1.User experience: A native apps offers more consistency in the user experience, which can create brand loyal customers, 
as well as more engaged users.

2. Optimized UI: Native UI framworks allow the ability to create platform-specific user interfaces that can create an easier
to use and more visually pleasing app.

3.Performance: Native apps offer better performance compared to web or hybrid applications. Given that the app will have features like real-time product browsing, push notifications, and image-heavy content, performance is will be vital.

4. Offline Mode: The retail company specifically requires support for offline mode, allowing users to browse products and view their order history without an internet connection. Native apps excel in offline functionality, allowing to provide this feature seamlessly.
## Consequences 

Developing a Native app involves platform-specific development efforts, which may lead to higher initial development costs compared to web or hybrid apps. Also, maintaining separate codebases for iOS and Android may require additional resources.

However, the benefits of the performance, offline support, and access to device features outweigh these considerations.
