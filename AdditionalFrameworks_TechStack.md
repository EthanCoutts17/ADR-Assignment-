Title: Additional Framworks and technology Stacks 

## Context 

Creating a mobile app for a retail company. The app's requirements include supporting offline mode, push notifications, payment gateway integration, analytics tracking and image display optimization. 
it was already decided to develop the app as a Native application. Now, need to decide on the additional frameworks and technology stacks required to meet these requirements.


## Decision 

It was decided that the following frameworks and technology stacks would be used 

- Firebase for push notifications 
- Google Analytics for user behavior tracking 
- Amazon S3 for image storage 


## Rationale 


1.Firebase for Push Notifications:

Reliability: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) provides a reliable and scalable solution for handling push notifications, ensuring that customers receive timely updates regarding order status, new product arrivals, and exclusive offers.
Cross-Platform Support: Firebase supports both iOS and Android, simplifying push notification management across platforms.
In-App Messaging: Firebase In-App Messaging can be used to personalize and optimize the sending of notifications, creating a better user experience.

2. Google Analytics for User Behavior Tracking:

Insightful Analytics: Google Analytics offers viable user behavior tracking, allowing to gather valuable insights about how customers use the app, including product views, purchases, and loyalty program engagement.
Data-Driven Decisions: The collected data will help make data-driven decisions to improve overal app performance and user experience.

3.Amazon S3 for Image Storage:

Scalable Image Storage: Amazon S3 is a reliable and scalable solution for storing product images of varying sizes and resolutions. It allows for efficient caching, lazy loading, and compression to optimize image delivery and app performance.



## Consequences 

Implementing these additional frameworks and technology stacks requires integration efforts, ensuring that they work properly within the app. Developers need to familiarize themselves with the APIs and features of Firebase, Google Analytics, 
and Amazon S3 to maximize their benefits.

Proper configuration and usage of these services are necessary to maintain data security, performance, and user experience. It's important to stay up-to-date with changes and updates to these services and ensure they align with the app's continuous evolving  requirements.
